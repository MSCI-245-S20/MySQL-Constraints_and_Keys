In previous units, we've covered the 4 main SQL keywords that let us **manipulate data** in a relational database, also known as _CRUD_: 

- `SELECT`
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

Also, we covered main SQL **data definition** statements such as: 

- `CREATE DATABASE`
- `CREATE TABLE`
- `ALTER TABLE`
- `DROP TABLE`
- `DROP DATABASE`

From the previous list, the `CREATE TABLE` statement, needs to be defined with SQL data types and SQL constraints.
