Regarding SQL constraints, we've covered the `NOT NULL` and the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint, in this unit, we are going to cover a new SQL constraint: __foreign keys__.

By defining _Foreign keys_, we can create more advanced SQL `SELECT` queries using the `mysql` command line. 

These new `SELECT` queries will use a technology called: `JOINS`.

SQL `JOINS` allow us to select data from two or more tables or databases __based on a common field between them__: the _foreign key_.

Let's begin by examining the data from 2 different databases in the next section.
