Regarding SQL constraints, we've covered the `NOT NULL` and the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint. 

In this unit, we are going to cover 2 new SQL constraints: the `FOREIGN KEY` and the `UNIQUE KEY`.

As the name implies, _unique keys_ only allow values that are not repeated in the same table column.

On the other hand, _foreign keys_ work as a __common field between 2 or more tables__ allowing us to make more advanced SQL `SELECT` queries.

These new `SELECT` queries will use a new SQL statement called: `JOIN`.

Let's begin by examining the data from 2 different tables in the next section.
