As you have experienced, relationships between different database tables are a very common of organizing data in a relational database system.

In this last set of challenges, you'll be working with a `blog` database. This database will have a `posts` table, a `users` table and a `comments` table. 

The `posts` table will have 1 reference column, the `user_id` column, to know what user created the content in a specific post. 

On the other hand, the `comments` table will have the `post_id` column to know what post the comment belongs to and a `user_id` to know what user created the comment.
